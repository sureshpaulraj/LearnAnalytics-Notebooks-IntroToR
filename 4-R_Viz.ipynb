    "1. Critically, press `Ctrl+Enter` to run (or render) the current cell.\n",
    "2. Output will print to the notebook. You may have to scroll up to see it all.\n",
    "3. Get help for any function by typing a question mark and then its name into\n",
    "   the console: `?rxLinMod`. It will split the window, and will bring up the documentation for \n",
    "   that function below.\n",
    "5. Files will appear in the specified directory. You can find them by selecting File in the menu bar and selecting \"Open...\". This will open a new browser window with a file navigator.\n",
    "6. R objects can be viewed by typing `ls()` in an R cell.\n",
    "7. Run all the example code!\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a number of hands-on exercises in the document, so while you can run the notebook from beginning to end, you will get a lot more out of it by actually walking through cell-by-cell, and filling out the corresponding exercises.\n",

You do not need to look at it, but if you are interested, you can view the configuration file [here](Resources/config.R). It may take a few moments to run the first time you run it, but it should be fast afterwards."
